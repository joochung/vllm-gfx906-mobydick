# 0.30.0 merge review — which conflicts are our live code, and which are dead weight

**Second correction (this one matters):** my first pass put four
off-by-default switches in a "verify then delete" bucket as if they were parked
experiments. Three of them are the opposite — **gated wins whose gate already
passed and whose only open item is a default flip**: `SKINNY_M16` (measured
+14.5 % / +6.1 %), `QUANT_LAYER0_MOE` (measured +3.0 %), and the FD-1/A3 flag
(a revived mechanism with three tests and an in-tree consumer). Table 2 now
carries the record per switch. The lesson: *off by default ≠ dead* — on this box
a default flip is a deliberate, documented "Kevin's call" step, so grep the dev
logs and the roadmap for the flag before proposing a deletion.

## Table 1 — the 31 conflicts, by class

Classes: **L** = our live gfx906 code (default-on or model-support; resolve by
hand) · **G** = our code that is **gated off by default** (archive candidate) ·
**C** = an upstream commit our fork carries (cherry-pick) or a fix upstream also
has (take theirs, drop our copy) · **D** = bindings/CI/test glue (mechanical).

**Reading of Table 1:** only **one** of the 31 is our code that is *off by
default* (`mamba_mixer2.py`, NH-4). ~11 are our live feature code and need a real
hand-merge; ~10 are upstream commits we carry, where 0.30.0 already has its own
(or better) version and the right move is to **drop our copy** rather than
re-apply it; the rest is additive glue.

## Table 2 — off-by-default switches: **check the record before deleting**

Lesson from the first pass of this doc: *off by default ≠ dead*. Three of the six
switches I first listed as deletion candidates are **gated wins whose gate already
passed and whose only open item is a default flip** (Kevin's call). The record, per
switch:

| flag | status in our own docs | recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| `VLLM_GFX906_SKINNY_M16` | **SHIPPED, not parked** — `DEVLOG-fp16-skinny.md`: 35B MoE N=8 graph **+14.5 %** (191.0 vs 166.9 t/s), 27B (Qwen3.8) N=8 **+6.1 %**, 27B N=4 control flat (−0.6 %, flag inert); kernel correctness + per-shape 2–7.5× PASS; *"the A/B arms are positive on both models and the flag-on soak passed (30 reps × 2 models, flat), so `VLLM_GFX906_SKINNY_M16=1` is cleared to go default-on; flipping it is Kevin's call"* | **FLIP, do not delete.** It covers the M=5..16 spec-verify / 5–16-seq concurrent-decode regime; today we leave the win unclaimed. Caveat on record: the ksplit>1 epilogue is fp16 `atomicAdd` (same property as the shipped M≤4 rail) | 
| `VLLM_GFX906_QUANT_LAYER0_MOE` | **GO, not parked** — `ROADMAP.md` C4 + `DEVLOG-c4-layer0-quant.md`: unquantized layer-0 experts cost ~740 µs/call vs 182 µs for the W4A16 rail ⇒ ~558 µs/step; gates all passed — unit 8/8, PPL 15.9531 → **15.9929** (Δ +0.04, gate < 0.5), greedy fingerprint bit-identical (`d2e5262183c6b92f`), serving A/B off 84.95 → **87.51 t/s = +3.0 %** (noise floor ~1.8 %); ~1.5 GiB returned to graph capture. Open item: *"default-on decision after soak"* | **FLIP (soak is a process call, the measurements are done), do not delete** — it is a quality trade-off the checkpoint author did not make, so it is Kevin's call, but the numbers are in |
| `VLLM_GFX906_FUSED_DRAFT` | **live, not dead** — `tests/kernels/attention/test_gfx906_fa.py` "A3 (revived 2026-09-14 on the V2 bring-up branch)": the flag is the opt-in for the fused multi-step draft *metadata* protocol, whose consumer **is in-tree** (`v1/worker/gpu/spec_decode/autoregressive/speculator.py:_generate_fused_drafts`), pinned by **three tests** (flag, view contract, and an end-to-end reuse/corruption guard). `DEAD-ENDS.md`'s "has no reader in-tree now" is **stale** — the reader is the gfx906 FA builder, the attribute consumer is upstream V2 | **KEEP; fix the stale DEAD-ENDS row.** FD-1's *neutral* verdict was about the B=4/120k offline arm (stack-confounded), not about deleting the mechanism |
| `VLLM_GFX906_MAMBA_FUSED_GROUP_NORM` | NH-4: gate **ran** 2026-08-30 (A–B–A, fresh boot/arm, TP=2+EP): A 109.8 / B 110.05 / A2 109.37 t/s = +0.4 % inside noise (the A-vs-A2 drift exceeds the effect), PPL 24.9034 vs 24.8944, 0 top-20 misses; isolated 68→55 µs/layer ≈ 0.29 ms/step, hidden by a MoE-GEMV-bound step. The dev log labels it SHIPPED with the flip documented as a one-liner for a config that stops being GEMV-bound; the in-code comment still says "pending the A/B" (stale) | strip is **behaviorally safe** (default-off, measured-neutral in the served config) and saves 23 conflict lines; keeping it costs the same 23 lines at merge. Genuinely optional — my default is keep, fix the comment |
| `VLLM_GFX906_FA_STRICT` | a fail-closed *policy* switch (raise instead of warn when FA degrades quietly) | keep — not dead code |
| `VLLM_GFX906_MOE_BM`/`_M1`/`_NPT`, `GEMV_RPT`, `GEMVM_RPT`, `GEMV_I8_RPT`, `W8A16_INT8*`, `QGEMM_M1_MAXILP` | null-means-on (default **on**) | keep |

Switches already default-on (`ALIGN_M1`, `DENSE_GEMV`, `DOWN_GEMV`,
`SORT_FREE_SMALL_K`, `SPEC_CG_SMALL`, `SPEC_GEMM`, `TOPK_SINGLE_GROUP`) are live.

## Proposed plan (revised after checking the records)

1. **Flip the two gated wins** (one-line default change each, no new code):
   `VLLM_GFX906_SKINNY_M16` (measured +14.5 % / +6.1 % at N=8, soak passed) and
   `VLLM_GFX906_QUANT_LAYER0_MOE` (measured +3.0 % serving). Both flips should be
   followed by the house gates (35B `_bench_gfx906.py`, PPL probe, and the
   `tests/kernels/moe/test_c4_layer0_quant.py` / FA suites) — the measurements
   exist, the *defaults* are what is missing.
2. **Fix the stale records** rather than delete code: `DEAD-ENDS.md`'s FD-1 "no
   reader" line (the A3 opt-in was revived with three tests) and the NH-4 comment
   in `mamba_mixer2.py` ("pending the serving A/B gate" — the gate ran and was
   neutral).
3. **Optional hygiene:** strip NH-4 only (default-off, measured-neutral, 23 lines)
   and preserve it on an `archive/gfx906-dead-2` branch — do it as a separate,
   revertible commit if the tree should be lean. I would keep it: the merge costs
   the same 23 lines either way, and the dev log kept the flip deliberately.
4. **Do not** delete `SKINNY_M16`, `QUANT_LAYER0_MOE` or the FD-1 flag; all three
   have measured or test-guarded reasons to exist (Table 2).
5. **For the merge itself**, the work is: hand-merge the ~11 live-code conflicts,
   take 0.30.0's version for the ~10 upstream carries (re-checking only the three a
   served model needed: Zen CPU path, mamba prefix-cache warning, DFlash RoPE
   layout), and resolve the glue. Nothing in the conflict set is worth deleting to
   make the merge smaller — the largest single our-side conflict is 494 lines
   (`layers/utils.py`, live code), and the off-by-default items are 23 lines or
   live-elsewhere.

## Open questions for Kevin

- Flip `SKINNY_M16` and `QUANT_LAYER0_MOE` to default-on now (with the two gates
  re-run on the same boot), or keep them opt-in? Both logs say "Kevin's call".
- NH-4: keep the 23 lines and fix the comment, or strip-and-archive for a lean tree?
- The ~10 upstream carries: retire them wholesale on the merge (take 0.30.0's
  versions) or re-apply per model?
